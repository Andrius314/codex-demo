Santrauka: Google is officially turning Chrome into a playground for AI agents. For years, AI ‘browsers’ have relied on a messy process: taking screenshots of websites, running them through vision models, and guessing where to click. This method is slow, breaks easily, a

Santrauka: In the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), speed is the only feature that matters once accuracy is solved. For a human, waiting 1 second for a search result is fine. For an AI agent performing 10 sequential searches to solve a complex task, a 1-second delay
